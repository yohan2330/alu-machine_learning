    Performs a convolution on grayscale images with custom padding

    images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w) containing

    padding is a tuple of (ph, pw)
        ph is the padding for the height of the image
        pw is the padding for the width of the image
        the image should be padded with 0's
